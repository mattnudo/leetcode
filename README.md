# leetcode

This is a collection of the Leetcode problems I've been solving over time.

The folder splits by language and then by pattern type (arrays, dynamic programming, BST, etc)

Most problems have been solved in Python.

This is my only public repository, but I have ~ a dozen private pet projects that I have been working on over the years, ranging from Python/Django backend deployed using Helm and Kubernetes, to React/Typescript FE, Ruby on Rails FS.
