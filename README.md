# leetcode

This is my one public repository, among a dozen private pet project repositories that I have been tinkering with over the last decade and a half for fun and leisure. My private repos cover tech ranging from Python/Django backend deployed using Helm and Kubernetes, to React/Typescript FE, Ruby on Rails FS.

This is a collection of the Leetcode problems I've solved over time.

I enjoy staying on top of both DSA and system design, and this repository captures the DSA problems I've solved.

This repository organizes solutions by language, and then by pattern type (arrays, dynamic programming, BST, etc)

Most problems have been solved in Python, as it is the language I have become most familiar with over the last few years.
